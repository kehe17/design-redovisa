All blogs are cats
==================================

It's a cat picture. As I wrote on the title page, all blogs are about cats. Now you're probably thinking there are lots of blogs out there which have nothing at all to do with cats, but there really aren't.

Every single blog is in some way connected to cats, it's usually hidden very cleverly, but it's cats all the way down. This might sound like the ramblings of a madman and that's because they are, but I have to write something in these posts, I can't just post cat pictures and nothing else. Anyway, here's the picture again...
